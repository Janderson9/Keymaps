# Keymaps

My keymapping for 65% Quefrency v1 by Keebio. Specifically to switch between MacOS and Windows.
Holding Function key in bottom left while pressing LGUI (for MacOS) or LCTRL (for Windows) will select the functionality of "caps lock" to appropriately be ctrl/cmd key. 
For clarity all keys with "/" are always "MacOS / Windows"
Bottom row is: 
Function , ctrl , alt , [cmd / win] , space || space , [Right Command / Shift+tab(toggles overlay in steam)] , [cmd+c / ctrl+c] , [cmd+v / ctrl+v] , left, down, up

Layer 3 (selectable with FN+RGUI) is the same as "Windows Mode" with different Macros on the right side.
